# Expanding Cards
This project is part of the [course.](https://50projects-50-days.netlify.app/)

In this project, there are five cards, each showcasing a unique natural background. Hovering over a card expands it, providing a more detailed view of the image. A suitable title also appears in the bottom-left corner of each card.

I've made a few adjustments to the original design. Rather than clicking to expand a panel, you can now simply hover over a card to enlarge it. I also added a flickering animation effect to the title for a bit of extra style. Feel free to check out the live [live demo.](https://mahmudolhasan.github.io/Expanding-Cards/)
