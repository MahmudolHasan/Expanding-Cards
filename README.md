Expanding Cards
This project is part of a [course.](https://50projects-50-days.netlify.app/)

I made a few adjustments to the original design. Instead of clicking an element to expand the panel, you can now hover over it to enlarge the view. I also added a title with a flicker animation effect for added style. Feel free to check out the [live demo.](https://mahmudolhasan.github.io/Expanding-Cards/)
